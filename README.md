# Forum Project

**Still under development** 
**One step/feaure at a time ** 

## Overview
This is a forum for anonymous postings. Meant to be light weight. It does not suppost image/video injections. It allows discussions on any topic not prohibited by law.
The forum is designed to let users engage in conversations without revealing their identities. While user authentication is not yet implemented, the planned feature will allow users to create accounts for posting 
and replying to topics and trends anonymously. No user data will be held besides basic profile credentials. 

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)
  - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js

## Current Status

The project is still under development. The core functionality for anonymous postings is in place, but features such as user authentication are yet to be implemented.
## Suggestions 
Any suggestions are welcome.
